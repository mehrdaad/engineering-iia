How long did it take life to come about?; About 1B years.
How might you think about life as a single process?; As one firework-like chemical reaction that has lastest for ages.
What is the current view of the speed of life as a evolutionary process?; Why didn't it happen faster?
Is the jump from cells to multi-cellular organisms seen as large relative to progress up till having cells?; No.
When was the Big Bang?; 13.7B years ago (est).
When did we have eukaryotes?; 2.4B years ago (est).
When did we have animals?; 600M years ago (est).
When did we have humans?; 6M years ago (est).

Can much microbial life be cultured in the lab?; No. <1%. (Check by comparing species counted from sequencing DNA in soil and counting species grown from that DNA in a plate.)

Describe the cycle of natural selection.; 0. We have some heritable material. 1. Some mutates. 2. These give rise to variations. 3. These provide selection: things with variations may die out or become more abundant. 4 (1). Some of these may mutate, closing the cycle.

What are the principles of evolution (vague)?; 1. Heritable traits that promote survival and reproduction become more common in a population over time. 2. Genetic variation provides diversity (need mutation). 3. Competition provides the necessary selective force.

What are examples of selection?; <ol> <li>Environmental selection for local adaptation.</li> <li>Sexual selection for overall fitness or ornamentation (peacock tails).</li> </ol>

What is a genotype?; A mutation. A unique genome, a complete heritable genetic identity.

What is a phenotype?; <ul> <li>A variation, a description of your actual physical characteristics. E.g. 'having dark hair'. </li> <li>Most phenotypes are influenced by both your genotype and your environment.</li><</ul>

What is the theory of evolution?;<ul><li>Unified theory to explain diversity of life on earth.</li><li>Genes produce an organism's inherited traits.</li><li>Mutation and genetic drifts provide random fluctuations in a population.</li><li>Selection increases the frequency of useful traits (e.g. resistance to viruses).</li><li>Speciation occurs by isolation or other selection mechanisms, e.g. geographical or time (fruit flies).</li></ul>

Have mass extinctions occurred?; Yes, several times. E.g. dinos.

What is phylogeny?; The process of organising organisms into trees based on relationships (prev by observation, now by DNA sequencing).

What are the broad groups of life (main components of the phylogenetic tree of life)?; Bacteria, archaea and eukaryota.

What are bacteria?; E.g. yoghurt. TODO

What are archaea?; <ul><li>More suited to living in extreme environments. (Before earth stabilised, likely many archaea. 'Archaic' life forms.)</li><li>Molecularly similar to bacteria and eukaryotes.</li></ul>

What are eukaryotes?; Everything big you can see and microbes. TODO: check

Is the difference between bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes clear-cut?; No. There is gene exchange between them. E.g. bacteria that give rise to chloroplasts are eukaryotes. (Check this.) Bacteria are very good at swapping genes. Some asexual animals also swap genes.

Where can we interfere in natural selection?; <ul><li>Mutation: can carry out mutagenesis randomly (use chemicals to induce) or can design specific mutations (e.g. CRISPR). Can also introduce new functions by adding genes.</li><li>This leads to directed generation of diversity (variation). We also have artificial selection.</li></ul>

What is CRISPR?; TODO

Examples of artificial selection by humans; Crops (decrease var in size of plants like corn, keep fruit size constant, to conserve energy), select vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower from wild mustard, select dogs from wolves.

How can most of the genetic variability in dogs be found in wolves, who look similar to each other?; Latent genetic variability not expressed in phenotypes, but may be if there is sufficient selection pressure.

How many copies of most genes do humans have?; Two - one from the mother and one from the father.

Is genetic variability expressed fully in humans?; Nqo - latent genetic variability may be masked by the 'good' copy of the gene if that gene is dominant (vs recessive).

What is The Lenski Affair?; <ul><li>Lenski started with 12 identical cit- E-coli cultures</li><li>Grew with selective pressure (limiting glucose and excess citrate) and diluted each day</li><li>Repeated for ~25y, freezing every 500 generations</li><li>Observed weak cit+ growth at gen 31,500 in one culture only</li><li>When going back up to 2k gens, replaying the experiment (using frozen samples as fossil record) led to 'inevitable cit+' mutation</li></ul>

What are the main takeaways from the Lenski Affair?; <ul><li>Evidence for potentiating mutation(s)</li><li>Evolution under controlled laboratory conditions</li></ul>
